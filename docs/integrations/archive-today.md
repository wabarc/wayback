You can enable or disable this feature using the `--is` flag or the `WAYBACK_ENABLE_IS` environment variable, which is enabled by default.

The code for wayback's implementation of the Internet Archive integration can be found in the [wabarc/archive.is](https://github.com/wabarc/archive.is) repository.
