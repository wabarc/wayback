Wayback relies on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) as an upstream service for wayback and playback.
You can enable or disable this feature using the `--ia` flag or the `WAYBACK_ENABLE_IA` environment variable, which is enabled by default.

The code for wayback's implementation of the Internet Archive integration can be found in the [wabarc/archive.org](https://github.com/wabarc/archive.org) repository.
