Wayback metrics provide important insights into the performance and status of the Wayback service.
These metrics include memory usage, which helps track the amount of memory used by the service;
request status, which helps identify the status of incoming requests and whether they are being successfully handled;
publish status, which helps track the status of published web pages;
and garbage collection, which helps track the removal of unused web pages to free up memory.
By monitoring these metrics, users can gain a better understanding of the overall health of the Wayback service and identify any issues that may need to be addressed.

In each wayback service, the command `/metrics` can be used to obtain metrics.
