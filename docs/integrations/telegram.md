2. Start a chat with BotFather by clicking the "Start" button.
3. Send the command `/newbot` to BotFather to create a new bot.
4. Follow the instructions from BotFather and provide a name and username for your bot.
5. After creating the bot, BotFather will provide you with a token.
6. To test your bot, open a chat with your bot by searching for its username and send a message.
7. You can also customize your bot by sending commands to BotFather, such as `/setdescription` and `/setuserpic`.

Optionally, you can also create a channel for publishing.
