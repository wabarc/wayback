title: Wayback to Telegraph
---

[Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) â€“ a publishing tool that lets you create richly formatted posts with photos and all sorts of embedded stuff.

Wayback relies on [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) as an upstream service storing sanitized web pages.
You can enable or disable this feature using the `--ph` flag or the `WAYBACK_ENABLE_PH` environment variable, which is enabled by default.
The content is saved using a new anonymous account generated by wayback each time, and is not associated with the requester.

The code for wayback's implementation of the Telegraph integration can be found in the [wabarc/telegra.ph](https://github.com/wabarc/telegra.ph) repository.
